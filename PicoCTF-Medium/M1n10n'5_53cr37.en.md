After warming up with a few “Easy” challenges, I decided to test myself with a “Medium” one called **M1n10n'5_53cr37**.
This challenge belongs to the **Reverse Engineering** category and requires analyzing an Android application file (`.apk`).
Contrary to my expectation, the hardest part wasn’t finding the flag — it was the battle against the tools and environment themselves.

---

### **1. Phase 1: Struggling with Environment & Tools**

This was the most difficult phase, but also where I learned the most about debugging.

* **Initial issue:** When using the `jadx` version installed via `apt`, it constantly threw errors — “file not found,” “permission denied,” and finally produced an empty output folder.

* **Solution:** After numerous debugging steps (using `sudo`, changing directories, checking permissions…), I discovered the issue was with the `jadx` version from `apt`.
  The final fix was:

  1. **Work in a “clean room”:** Copy the `minions.apk` file into the Linux home directory (`~`) to avoid permission conflicts with Windows.
  2. **Manual installation:** Download the latest version of `jadx` directly from GitHub.
  3. **Install dependencies:** Install Java (`default-jdk`) so that `jadx` can run properly.

* **Lesson learned:** The working environment is part of the challenge. When a tool doesn’t work, don’t hesitate to remove it and try a more stable version. Always check the dependencies of your tools.

### **2. Dissecting & Following the Trail**

Once `jadx` was running smoothly, the real investigation began.

* **Step 1: Decompile the APK file**
  Using the downloaded `jadx` version to decompile the file `minions.apk`:

  ```bash
  # Run from the directory containing jadx and the apk file
  ./jadx-1.4.7/bin/jadx -d Minionsapp-source minions.apk
  ```

  This command successfully created a directory named `Minionsapp-source` containing the application’s source code.

* **Step 2: Changing strategy**
  At first, I tried using `grep` to search for keywords like “picoCTF” and “flag,” but found nothing.
  Then the hint from the author — *“Any interesting source files?”* — pointed me in a new direction: stop searching inside the content, start looking at **file names**.

* **Step 3: Finding the “interesting file”**
  I used `find .` to list the entire directory tree and combined it with `grep -v` to remove noise.
  Among hundreds of system files, one stood out:
  `sources/com/example/picoctfimage/MainActivity.java` — clearly a file written by the challenge author.

* **Step 4: Following the thread**
  However, `MainActivity.java` turned out to be another decoy — it only contained default code.
  Yet, one line of code was the key:
  `setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)` — this line links to the layout file `activity_main.xml`.
  Inspecting that file, I found a direct hint inside a `TextView`:
  `"Look into me my Banana Value is interesting"`.

* **Step 5: The final clue**
  The hint about “Banana Value” led me to `strings.xml` (where string values are stored).
  As expected, there was a string named **“Banana”**:

  ```xml
  <string name="Banana">OBUWG32DKRDHWMLUL53TI43OG5PWQNDSMRPXK3TSGR3DG3BRNY4V65DIGNPW2MDCGFWDGX3DGBSDG7I=</string>
  ```

---

### **3. Decoding & Result**

The string clearly showed signs of **Base32 encoding** (uppercase letters, digits 2–7, and ending with `=`).
I used the following command to decode it:

```bash
echo "OBUWG32DKRDHWMLUL53TI43OG5PWQNDSMRPXK3TSGR3DG3BRNY4V65DIGNPW2MDCGFWDGX3DGBSDG7I=" | base32 -d
```

And the final flag appeared:

**`picoCTF{p1c0_15_v3ry_c0nfus1n9_555f6576}`**

---

### **4. Lessons Learned**

* This challenge taught me a complete workflow for reverse-engineering an Android app: from fixing the environment, exploring the directory tree, tracing the connections between Java code and XML resources, to decoding the final string.
* Most importantly, it showed that **debugging skills and persistence** matter more than just knowing the answer in advance.
  Every error becomes a lesson — and each lesson brings you closer to the flag.
